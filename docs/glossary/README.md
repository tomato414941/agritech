# AgriTech Multilingual Glossary

This directory contains the multilingual glossary for the AgriTech project. English serves as the base language for all terminology.

## Available Languages
- [English (Base)](en.md)
- [Japanese / 日本語](ja.md)
- [Term Mapping / 用語対応表](mapping.md)

## How to Use the Glossary
- Reference the English glossary (`en.md`) as the authoritative source for all terms
- Language-specific glossaries are translations of the English terms
- Use `mapping.md` to find term correspondences between languages
- When adding new terms, always start with the English definition

## Maintenance Guidelines
1. Term Addition Process
   - First add the term and definition to the English glossary
   - Then create corresponding entries in other language files
   - Finally, update the mapping file

2. Quality Control
   - All terms must have an English definition
   - Translations should be reviewed by native speakers
   - Create an issue for term additions or modifications

3. Version Control
   - Major terminology changes should be documented in CHANGELOG.md
   - Each term should maintain consistent meaning across all languages

## Contributing
- Submit new terms through issues
- Include both English definition and translations
- Provide context and usage examples where appropriate
